## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Removed Broker Assignment Requirement** âœ…
**Issue**: Investors were required to be permanently assigned to a broker  
**Solution**: Removed the `_check_broker_assignment` constraint from `res_users.py`  
**Result**: Investors can now work with ANY broker dynamically

**Changes Made**:
- Removed constraint that enforced broker assignment
- Made `broker_id` field optional (not required)
- Updated field help text to clarify it's optional

### 2. **Fixed Price Validation with Decimal Precision** âœ…
**Issue**: Float arithmetic caused false validation errors (e.g., 175.00 % 0.01 â‰  0)  
**Solution**: Implemented Decimal-based validation for tick size compliance

**Files Updated**:
- `models/stock_security.py` - Added Decimal import and fixed `_check_tick_size`
- `models/stock_order.py` - Added Decimal import and fixed price validation

### 3. **Corrected Demo Data Structure** âœ…
Fixed multiple issues in `demo/demo.xml`:
- Removed invalid field names (`principal_amount` â†’ `amount` for loans)
- Removed direct trade creation (trades are created through order matching)
- Removed duplicate config record (auto-created per company)
- Added missing required fields (term_months, collateral for loans)
- Fixed broker assignments to be optional
