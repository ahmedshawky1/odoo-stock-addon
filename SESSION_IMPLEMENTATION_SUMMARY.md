# Session Start/End Implementation - Changes Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive session start/end logic matching C# reference code, including price snapshots, interest calculations, and auto-session creation.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. **models/stock_security.py**
**Added:**
- `price_to_compare_with` field (Float) - Reference price for comparison, updated at session start/end

**Purpose:** Matches C# dual price tracking (sessionStartPrice + PriceToCompareWith)

---

### 2. **models/stock_session.py**
**Modified:**
- `action_open_session()` - Enhanced with status filtering and dual price updates
- `action_close_session()` - Complete rewrite with price history snapshots and interest processing

**Added Methods:**
- `_process_session_interest()` - Calculates interest for all deposits and loans
- `_create_next_session()` - Auto-creates next session when current one closes

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Filters securities by status (excludes liquidated/expired)
- ✅ Updates both `session_start_price` AND `price_to_compare_with`
- ✅ Records price history snapshots for ALL securities at session end
- ✅ Processes deposit/loan interest calculations
- ✅ Auto-creates next session (configurable via system parameter)
- ✅ Enhanced logging and notifications

---

### 3. **models/stock_price_history.py**
**Added:**
- `'session_end'` to `change_reason` selection field

**Purpose:** Distinguish session-end price snapshots from trade-based price changes

---

### 4. **models/stock_deposit.py**
**Added:**
- `_calculate_interest()` method - Calculates and applies interest for approved deposits

**Logic:**
- Simple interest calculation: (amount × rate × days) / (365 × 100)
- Updates `current_value` and `interest_earned` fields
- Logs all calculations

---

### 5. **models/stock_loan.py**
**Added:**
- `_calculate_interest()` method - Calculates and applies interest for approved loans

**Logic:**
- Interest calculation: (amount × rate × days) / (365 × 100)
- Updates `outstanding_balance` and `total_interest` fields
- Logs all calculations

---

### 6. **views/stock_security_views.xml**
**Modified:**
- Added `price_to_compare_with` field to Trading Information page

**Location:** Form view → Trading Information tab → Market Data group

---

### 7. **__manifest__.py**
**Modified:**
- Version bumped from `1.0` to `1.0.1`

**Purpose:** Ensures proper module upgrade detection

## Functionality Comparison: C# vs Odoo

| Feature | C# Implementation | Odoo Implementation | Status |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Update session status | ✅ Sets "Active"/"Stopped" | ✅ Sets 'open'/'closed' | ✅ Done |
| Set start date | ✅ StartDate field | ✅ start_date field | ✅ Done |
| Status filtering | ✅ Excludes liquidated/expired | ✅ Excludes liquidated/expired | ✅ Done |
| Dual price updates | ✅ sessionStartPrice + PriceToCompareWith | ✅ session_start_price + price_to_compare_with | ✅ Done |
| News notifications | ✅ Insert into News table | ✅ Chatter message_post | ✅ Done |
| Price history snapshots | ✅ Insert all securities at end | ✅ Create history records | ✅ Done |
| Interest calculation | ✅ Insert into "others" task | ✅ Direct calculation | ✅ Done |
| Auto-next session | ✅ Creates new session | ✅ Creates draft session | ✅ Done |
| Update previous_close | ❌ Not in C# | ✅ Sets previous_close | ✅ Enhanced |

## New Workflow

### Starting a Session

```python
session.action_open_session()
```

1. ✅ Validates session is in 'draft' state
2. ✅ Finds all active securities (not liquidated/expired)
3. ✅ For each security:
   - Sets `session_start_price` = `current_price`
   - Sets `price_to_compare_with` = `current_price`
4. ✅ Updates session state to 'open'
5. ✅ Sets `start_date` to current datetime
6. ✅ Posts notification to chatter
7. ✅ Logs count of updated securities

### Closing a Session

```python
session.action_close_session()
```

1. ✅ Validates session is in 'open' state
2. ✅ Cancels all pending orders
3. ✅ Finds all active securities (not liquidated/expired)
4. ✅ For each security:
   - Creates `stock.price.history` record with reason='session_end'
   - Sets `session_start_price` = `current_price`
   - Sets `price_to_compare_with` = `current_price`
   - Sets `previous_close` = `current_price`
5. ✅ Processes interest for all approved deposits
6. ✅ Processes interest for all approved loans
7. ✅ Updates session state to 'closed'
8. ✅ Sets `end_date` to current datetime
9. ✅ Posts notification with snapshot count
10. ✅ Optionally auto-creates next session (if configured)
11. ✅ Logs completion

---

## Configuration

### Auto-Create Next Session
Enable/disable via system parameter:

```python
# Enable (default)
self.env['ir.config_parameter'].sudo().set_param('stock_market.auto_create_next_session', 'True')

# Disable
self.env['ir.config_parameter'].sudo().set_param('stock_market.auto_create_next_session', 'False')
```

Or via Settings → Technical → Parameters → System Parameters

## Interest Calculation Details

### Deposits
- **Formula:** Interest = (Amount × Rate × Days) / (365 × 100)
- **Applied to:** Deposits with `state='approved'`
- **Updates:** `current_value` and `interest_earned`

### Loans
- **Formula:** Interest = (Amount × Rate × Days) / (365 × 100)
- **Applied to:** Loans with `state='approved'`
- **Updates:** `outstanding_balance` and `total_interest`

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create and start a session → verify securities updated
- [ ] Check `session_start_price` and `price_to_compare_with` are set
- [ ] Verify liquidated/expired securities are NOT updated
- [ ] Close session → verify price history records created
- [ ] Check interest calculated for deposits
- [ ] Check interest calculated for loans
- [ ] Verify next session auto-created (if enabled)
- [ ] Check chatter messages for start/end notifications
- [ ] Verify pending orders cancelled on close
- [ ] Test with no active securities → should not error

---

## Upgrade Instructions

```bash
# Stop and restart container
sudo docker restart odoo_stock

# Upgrade module
sudo docker exec -it odoo_stock odoo -u stock_market_simulation -d stock --stop-after-init

# Verify in logs
sudo docker logs odoo_stock | grep "stock_market_simulation"
```

---

## Database Migration Notes

### New Field
- `stock.security.price_to_compare_with` will be added with default NULL
- Existing records will have NULL until next session start

### No Breaking Changes
- All new fields are optional
- Existing workflows remain compatible
- Interest calculation is additive (won't break existing deposits/loans)

---

## Advantages Over C# Implementation

1. **Better Error Handling**
   - Try/except blocks with detailed logging
   - Graceful degradation (failed interest calc doesn't stop session close)

2. **Transaction Safety**
   - Odoo ORM ensures atomic operations
   - Rollback on failure

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All actions logged via chatter
   - mail.thread integration

4. **Flexibility**
   - Auto-next session is configurable
   - Interest calculation can be customized per deposit/loan type

5. **Security**
   - Built-in access rights
   - Domain filtering prevents unauthorized access

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- [ ] Add session-end report generation
- [ ] Email notifications to users when session starts/ends
- [ ] Dashboard showing session statistics
- [ ] Batch interest calculation optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Interest compounding options
- [ ] Session templates for recurring patterns
