- ✅ 12 Python model files
- ✅ 1 Controller file  
- ✅ 13 XML view files
- ✅ 2 Security configuration files
- ✅ 3 Data files
- ✅ 1 Demo data file

**Total Lines Reviewed:** ~8,000+ lines of Python and XML code

### 2. **Documentation Review** (Complete ✅)

---

## 🔧 Issues Found and Fixed

### Critical Issues ✅ ALL FIXED

#### 1. **Duplicate Function Definition**
**File:** `models/stock_order.py`  
**Problem:** `_validate_order()` function defined twice  
**Impact:** Would cause runtime errors  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Removed duplicate, kept enhanced version

#### 2. **Missing Logging Infrastructure**
**Files:** 4 critical model files  
**Problem:** No logging for error tracking  
**Impact:** Difficult debugging in production  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Added logging to all critical models

```python
Added to:
- models/stock_loan.py
- models/stock_deposit.py  
- models/stock_trade.py
- models/stock_session.py
```

#### 3. **Documentation Overload**
**Problem:** 11 documentation files with redundant information  
**Impact:** Confusing for developers and users  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Consolidated to 5 essential files
