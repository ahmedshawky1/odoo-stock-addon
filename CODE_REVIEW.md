## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Status ✅
```python
Database:
✅ Indexes on frequently queried fields
✅ Proper use of computed fields with store=True
✅ Efficient search domains
✅ Transaction management with savepoints

Application:
✅ Lazy loading where appropriate
✅ Batch processing for bulk operations
✅ Caching of configuration values
